# Mapping Ghana Health Infrastructure: 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/weslayton/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/mapping-ghana-health-infrastructure.ipynb

In this notebook I clean and analyze data on Ghana's health infrastructure. With the use of Plotly's powerful interactive visualizations, we're able to deepen the understanding of the health systems and even their distribution within the country.

# NFL Surface Analytics:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/weslayton/Data-Portfolio/blob/master/nfl-surface-analytics.ipynb

In this notebook I clean and analyze data given from the NFL in Kaggle's "NFL 1st and Future - Analytics" competition. By comparing the types of injuries, speed of players, and plotting the track of players on injury plays, we're able to compare the risk of injury on natural and synthetic playing surfaces.
